# Donald Barthelme and the organized chaos

Web to book --->
Book to printer --->
Text & pics to game --->
and back to book.

## work process
It was an interesting journey about literature and text, rhythm and data.
- I first scraped the web for content by Donald Barthelme. Youtube interviews, stories, pictures.
- Then I made a quick book that can be printed in an office printer (horizontally), and bind by one piece of string.
- I analyzed the text a bit, trying to get a sense of vocabulary and frequency of words.
- I turned the text into a game by extracting colors out of pictures I took in NY and choosing a word based on the color. every 20 seconds a word and color would appear on the screen, and I'll doodle it.
- The game was too random and the result didn't reveal anything about the text or about NY.
- I returned to the book and manually marked all appearances of I / Book / Sky / She / Day.
- When the text layer was hidden – patterns and rhythm revealed, and I knew this was what I was searching for.
